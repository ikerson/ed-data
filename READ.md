#  2018 PISA Data

> The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a worldwide study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in member and non-member nations intended to evaluate educational systems by measuring 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance on mathematics, science, and reading.

The most recent test results are for 2018. That year 79 countries participated. The 2021 tests did not occur due to COVID-19. They are set to take place in 2022 and should be released the following year. 

This repository contains two datasets. The first, contained in the `oecd_data` folder, includes the PISA scores and accompanying educational indicators reported by the OECD and made available at their website, [stats.oecd.org](https://stats.oecd.org/). The second collection of records in the `worldbank_data` folder contains PISA scores and key educational statistics from [World Bank databases](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/themes.html).

The goal of these datasets facilitate research into the correlations between educational indicators and student performance on the PISA.
